## Credits

Some of the inspiration for this project's code was derived from a video tutorial titled, "Build a Quiz App with JavaScript" on Youtube from the channel Web Dev Simplified.

Specifically, this was used for the functions which reveal the quiz questions, randomize them, and show the next question. This video also aided in the arrangement of the array structure, the selectChoice function and resetState function.

Completion of the project was done with the help of Rutgers' Slack learning assistants.
